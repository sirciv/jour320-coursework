          <h2>In the United States, we have a bicameral legislature, which means that bills have to be passed in two separate houses to become law.<br><br>We call these two houses the House of Representatives and the Senate. The U.S. Constitution requires at least half of the representatives and half of the senators to vote “yes” to pass a bill into law.</h2>

          <h2>But by 1837, a group of Whig party senators found a loophole. If they kept talking, using up all of the remaining time in the session, the bill could never be taken to a vote and fail. In order to achieve “cloture” and force a senator to stop talking, two-thirds of the Senate would have to vote so.</h2><br><br><h2>In 1957, Sentator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a staunch segregationist, filibustered the Civil Rights Act. Since then, its use every session has only increased.</h2><br><br>

          <h2>This loophole, known as a “filibuster,” was closed in the House of Representatives. Yet, it remained in the Senate. Vocal supporters of the filibuster call it “the Soul of the Senate,” claiming that it protects the right of politicians to speak, even if they are in the minority opinion.<br><br>But there’s one major issue: the filibuster gives just a small percentage of Americans the right to determine how the entire country is run.</h2>

          <h2>In a fair democracy, every vote should count equally. Yet, this doesn’t happen in the United States. Each state gets two senators, regardless of how big or small that state is. Which means the nearly 40,000,000 people in the most populous state of California get the same amount of representation in the Senate as the 600,000 people in the least populous state of Wyoming.<br><br>
